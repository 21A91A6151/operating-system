CPU BURST :begining of that process execution(movement of starting the process) 
REDI QUEUE : ready to execute

Algoritms:
========
PREMETIVE :  process can be stopped when any interepted is occur
NON PREMETIVE :process cannot  be stopped when any interepted is occur
           >>First come first serve(ffs)

gantt chat:it tells the time.it tells finish or starting time.

Analyzing the FCFS:
Merits: 
    >>>Better for long processs
    >>>Simple method
Demreits:
    >> if it is a small processs in second it waits until 1st one is completed.

Shortest job next (or)Shortest job first:
>>>non-premetive
>>>best for short procesess 

#rhel:
fn+alt+f2
ctrl+alt(for cursor)

commands:
=========
pwd
ls
ls -l :to know it is a file or directory
group and root is a same name-size in bytes-
clear (or) ctrl+l
to create file : touch <filename>
  >>>it creates an empty file
ls -l (or) ll<file name> that file properties it executes.

cat >file2 : to give contect also
to see--> cat file2
to add information to exiting files --> cat>>file2
rm file1 (it will delte file)
rm file2
rm -f file2(to do delete file without ask anything)
cp file1 file4(to copy file from 1 to 2)
diff file1 file2

mv file3 /file3(move and rename)

mkdir king(to crreate directory)
rm -rf files(to delete all at ones)
rm -rf * (rf -recent file)
su(to go to user environment)
cd-(change directory)
cd ..(to go back)
cd tab(to go)
cd/(to go front )

rm -rf name/
ls -ld filename
ls -l
cat /etc/passwd(to know user is created or not)
useradd veeru(to crearting user)
>>>passwd veeru
>>>
chmod - it is used to provide permissions.
esc: q!(to quit).
chown ownername filename(to chanage the owner)
groupadd filename (new group)
chgrp to change group name


vi[ to create data file]
chmod - for giving permissions

r=4
w=2
x=1
rw=6
rwx=7
chmod 777 <filename>
ls-l
ls-ld <filename>

getfacl  <filename>(we can get file command (access control)









FILE PERMISSIONS:
read
write 
execute
these are called cell scripting.

USER/OWNER: who created the file / directory
GROUP: couple of user is their
OTHERS:except user and group members.8


algoriths:
fcfs-(Fido)
sjf(shortest job first)-(shortest job next(SFJ)
rr-round robin(it is for time sharing systems)(quantum).
>>>for every process it given a chance
priority scheduling: the process will be given by some priority.
>>>run the process with highest priority.
>>>if two or more having same priority,use FFS.
if you have same priority of two or more numvers apply rr and ffs on that.
>>>priority -FCFS
>>>priority-RR.

every algorithm maintains only one queue.
only one redicue.|^
===========================================================================================================
multilevel queue algo:
>>>from here multiple redicues is their

ex:user redicue,kernal redicue etc
every redicue can go for multiple algoritms.
kernal process execute kernal system call.
batch is also called kernal process.
foreground process will have highest process.it executes user only.

interactive editing proceses(medial process)
iterative process(user process)

one any process is go to any redicue it doesnt go to another redicue..bcz it is allocated.
>>>foreground processes can be given 80% of cpu time for RR scheduling among its processes.
>>>the background queue can be given 20% of cpu .

if process wants highter redicue use multilevel feedback algo.

======================================
PROCESS ---->
>login(parent class)--->GUI/CLI -->shell(child process)--->execute some other process(another chid process)

THREADS: part of the process.
WEB BROWSER: process


os--->process--->thread
all thredas mapped to one kernal.
1 thread can access the kernal at a time.

process( 2 processors) -resource (resource will be released when process is done) 
dead lock : no process are able to finish bcz the resorces busy with another process.
*mutual exclusion: 
*hold and wait:
*no preemption : process not close , not break when resource is not available.
*circular wait : 
process sometimes can works on multiple resouces.
resources sometimes can works on multiple process.

Ostrich algorithm: if dead lock happens it reboots the system.
if cmp is continously reboots if effects hdd.
methods for handling deadlock:
======================
*deadlock detection:

*deadlock recovery
*deadlock avoidance
>>>how resources are to be requested.
**bankers algorithm: for mutiple instances of a resource type . it is also called safety algorithm.
>>>it is a powerfull algorithm
>>>available: available resources of each type.
>>>maximum: defines demand of that process.
>>>allocation:how many resources already allocated or  need resources for the process
>>>need: remaing resources need of each proceess(max - allocation)
**resourse allocation : for single instances of a resource type
Resourse allocation graph algo:
>>>

*deadlock prevention


safe state: if system doesnt have any cycle  deadlock .
unsafe state : may be dead lock occurs (changes occur state).

Networking :
make the systems connect and communicate with each other.
sharing and accessing the resources
resouce is any kind of information it might be a data , or audio ,video files etc.
the person who is sharing the information is server
who are accessing data they are clients.
topology : 2 types
1) pysical topology 
2)logicaltopology
the system how they are connected is called pysical topology
how these systems connected each other with logical is called logical tapology
work group and client server logical topologies
bus,star etc ..physical topologies
work group : work together as a group
client server model : it has a centralized resource, 
they are 2 types of addresses :
physical address --->by the manufacturer
mac address(unique entiti) -> media access control also known as pysical address no two mac address are same.
logical address(dynamically change) : ip address  we can change ip adress any times.

ip addesses are 2 types:
---------------------------
public ips and privite ips 
public : anyone can access
private - only authorized persons can access.
versions of ip  versions:
ipv4 - 32 bit (it have limited ip addresses)
ipv6 - 128 bit address (unlimited ip address)
ipv4 : 192.168.10.1 - total 4 octates(contains 8 bit(either 0 or 1) information)
           11100111.10010100.0111101.11110000(ip address in binary)
least significant bit 
000000000 :powers of 2
(0*2^7)+(0*2^6)+(0*2^5)+(0*2^4)+(0*2^3)+(0*2^2)+(0*2^1)+(0*2^0) = 0
most signifiacnt bit :
(1*2^7)+(1*2^6)+(1*2^5)+(1*2^4)+(1*2^3)+(1*2^2)+(1*2^1)+(1*2^0) = 128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1=255
classification of ipv4 :
ip address starts with 0 is invalid.
Class A: least value : 0-0000000 =0
              highest value : 0 - 1111111 =127(universal loop back)
   0 to 127
Class B: least value :10-000000=128
              highest value : 10 - 1111111 = 255-64 = 191
    128 to 191
Class C: least value : 110-00000 =192
              highest value : 110 - 11111= 255-32 = 223
    192 to 223
Class D:least value : 1110-0000 =128+64+32=224
              highest value : 1110 - 1111 = 239
      224 to 239
Class E: least value : 1111-0000 =128+64+32+16 =240
              highest value : 1111 - 1111 = 255
     240 to 255
0.0.0.0 unicast uddress.(one to one)
255.255.255.255 - broad cast address.(one to all)
multicasting (one to some people or one to some group oof people)


class - A : 0-127
class - B : 128 - 191
class -C : 192 - 223
class - D : 224 - 239
class - E : 240 - 255
to tell the class see only first octate.


subnet class:
===========
9 . 99 . 69 . 39
N . H . H . H
N-network part 
H - host ID /host part
in subnet mask u write n is 255 and h is 0
255.0.0.0 for class A

Claas B:
182.136.126.121
 N  .  N  . H  . H
255.255.0.0

class c:
193.123.122.187
N  .   N  . N  . H
255.255.255.0


class D:
224.123.134.145
N    . N .   N . H
it is used for multicasting.


Class E : 
N.N.N.H (research and development)

real utiilization of ip address - A,B,C
in c class less no.of ip address.
1st:
===
see how many no.of systems in that.so use that class in that.
Class A : 1.0.0.0 (in ip adress we find last octate is "0" it is network address)
1.0.0.1 (beginning ip address)
.
.
.
1.0.0.255

next :
====
1.0.1.1
1.0.255.255

1.1.0.1
1.255.255.255 - total host address - 255*255*255

2.0.0.1 
255.255.255.255

class B:
checks networks id: if td is change ..communication is not possible.
128.0.0.1
128.0.0.255

128.0.1.1
128.0.255.255

128.1.0.1(here network changes)(total host address 255*255)
128.255.255.255

class c:
192.0.0.1
192.0.0.255
192.0.1.1(here network changes )(here max 255 ip address are there)
192.0.255.255


networking is doesnt depending os .  for everey os it is same.
default gateway :
============
router interface which we cross whe we are entering others network








password breaking:
* restart button abd esc
*press  in e2 edit press e(edit)
go to linux line with cuscor -- go to end 
*write rd.break (interupting before kernel will be loaded)
*press ctrl -x to start
in emergency mode type "mount -o remount ,rw /sysroot"(mounting / sisroot)
chroot /sysroot(to go to main (system)root)
in sh : type "passwd root- enter
giving password
##cd /
ls 
ls -a
touch /.autorelabel
exit 
exit
exit / reboot

press e
=================
mount I grep /sysroot : used to see the access of that file.
cat .aurorelabel : to see the content on that

link is also called access layer.-> data link + physical
public ip : everyone can access it.
private ip: authorized ones can access it. 

2pow h -2 (real no of hosts)
subnetting : merge some bits to that 

for ipv6 - it is hexate
for ipv4- it is octate


degree of multiprogramming : 
to increse of degree of multiprogramming we use more ram.

memory management : 2 types
1)continueous
2)non - continuoes

os load in first block of ram
1)continues : secondary memory ------> ram ------>cpu
spamming or breaking is not possible in continuoes memory from one block to another block.
*fixed partitioning : the ram will partitioned in pre defined .
the partition is predefined before it will comung to the ram

wastage of that block is called internal fragmentation.

variable partioning /dynamic partitioning : there is no fixed or predefined partitioning 
it depends on demand

external fragmentation: continuuoes is major pblm in this
but it is possible because of compaction.
>stop the all programmes
>analyze the ram
>analauze all the blocks
>deallocate and alloacete is happens so it takes much time.
>it will take more time

these are the algorithms for internal and externnal fragmentation:
=============================================
first fit : it search from starts 
next fit : search from filled nxt block .  it searches from pointer.
best fit : it checks which one is best for that cmg processing . it is slow process bcz it analyse all the ram.
worst fit : reverse to the best fit.but sometimes it helps.


NON - CONTINGUOES MEMORY : 

paging : one process can split into pages(partitions) it happens only in secondary memory. after that pages comes into ram.
ram - the alloacation is in the form of frames(the pages).
page size = frame size
the cpu asking address that not absolute.
cpu asks only that byte.  for his purpose the mapping(MMU - memory management unit) is used.

mapping will convert the logical address asked by the cpu, it will convert the logical address to the physical address of the byte.
mapping created one page table .

frame - ram
pages - process

Virtual Memory(buffer memory):
======================
process - 10 pages - ram(10 frames)
2 pages - sec - virtual

virtual memory - double to physical memory.
page replacement :
=============
tme moving process from main to virtual memory is called swap out.
virtual to main is swap in.

page hit - page available in main memory - it takes nano seconds only.
page fault - page avalable in virtual memory - os comes - swap in occurs.
virtual - main memory - cpu(milli seconds - l milli sec = 10 lakh nano seconds)
page replacement uses swap in and swap out.
three algorithms for page replacement :
1)fifo - first in first out.
2)lru - least recently used. - 
3)optimal used - future

more page fault occurs : os is busy in page faults. if os is busy cpu doesnt do anything. bcz cpu doesnt getting any process.
 cpu utilization reduced. performance is reduced. because incrase the degree of multi programming.

thrashing : the sudden decrease of cpu utilization . trashing occurs bcz of page fault .
to avoid trashing we increase the main memory. and 
long term scheduler : 
f
demand paging:
===========
where u can replace the page is called demand paging.

secondary memory:

hdd - it used magnetic conductor.
sdd - it used semi conductor ,ssd will save. it is expensive bcz of 
ssd is very fast , size is less that is the disadvantage here.
flash
we use dram in main memory
sram we are used in ssd and cache,registers.
processor is also a semi conductor.
the first semi conductor manufactured unit  is in taiwan
manufacturing unit oof semi conductor in india (2nd one)
hybrid storage : some storage in ssd and some in hdd.


hdd- plater, header and steppor motor is the main parts of hdd.
plotter - combiination of steel and alluminium
header - read and write the data here , there is a small sensor . header doesnt touch the plotter. sensore only read and write the data.
steppor motor  - it gives power and then the disk is rotate.
hdd rpm in laptop: 5400 rpm
hdd rpm in desktop: 7200 rpm
rpm == good performance (read and write)
iops : input output operations per sec. the iops u have , good performance will get from hdd / sdd.

plotter : tracks(round shape) and sectors(small block)  the blocks will formed where  tracks and sectors formed in plotters.
format(deleting)- concept of format is creating the file system on pen drive and delete in pc.
data is saved in tracks.

File System:
=========
read and write header is move front and back only.
after shutdown the computer the present area of header is called parking point.(start of sector)
msdos - fat16
windoes 10,11 - new technology file system(ntfs)
linux file system - zfs(high capacity data)
facebook takes space in harddisk per day(zeta bytes of data)
os is automatically creates file system.
installing - the files that we require files from package to os.
in installation package we acquired .(automatic process).
but copy is used to handle file only.(some files)(manual process)
format(creating file system)

to utilize storage the hdd/sdd in proper way through the file system.

ext - linux
here ntfs not works bcz of comparitability.
ext - linux(hierarchy structure)
ntfs - windows(it wants utiilize the hdd in partitions)
working state is diff for both.


Windows : files and folders
files in folder
create file:
in linux : vi is used to create a file.
touch is ued to change the time spam .
delete a file :

data that refers to data is called meta data.


encrption : to change the data type so others cannot read it. to change the security settings.
compress : to reduce the size of the file.
attributes / meta data :  it we create a file , file having 2 diff things one is data and another is meta data.
to delete a file : if we del a file the file and meta data also delete.
rename : the name if the file or directory it change.
file meta data - type of file, location of file, hdd size , time .
meta data is saved in hdd.
hfdd needs some space system content saved is diff and user saved inforamtion is diff.
ram we use fully but hdd cant happens.
===============================================================================================
internal fragmentation : 
track sector ->block

Contiguoes allocation : the data blocks or file is saved in continuoes manner.

in continuoes the fie system seeking time is very fast .
disadvantage is file cant grow.

compaction :all the space holes comes to one place . but compaction ois difficult in mmeory management.
De- fragmentation : Defragmentation is the process of locating the noncontiguous fragments 
of data into which a computer file may be divided as it is stored on a hard disk,
and rearranging the fragments and restoring them into fewer fragments or into the whole file. 
Defragmentation reduces data access time and allows storage to be used more efficiently. 
black n\boxes : sytem files. we cant move them.

file system is software.
zfs : to put info anf tos eek info from data base zfs is ued.
in non-continuoes - there are 2 types : linked and indexed.
